# HTN-Backend-Challenge
This is my backend challenge.

This is my __first time__ making a graphQL server, so I will try to document my process,
the challenges I encountered, and how I fixed them.


## Setup

Node Server Dependencies:

1. cors - this is for https connections
2. dotenv - this is for environment variables such as postgres credentials
3. eslint - detect bugs and things I'm not doing properly
4. express - for node server
5. express-graphql, graphql - for query and mutation api
6. morgan - for debugging (this is more for REST apis, but including it would not be so bad for seeing the requests.)
7. nodemon - for debugging and testing
8. pg - postgres database!
